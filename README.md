<center><h1>KinderChat</h1></center>

KinderChat is a safe and fun chat application designed specifically for kids. The app allows children to communicate in a secure environment where every message is scanned by an advanced machine learning model to detect threats, negative comments, and inappropriate content. The chat is room-based, where kids can enter a room name and chat with others in the same room.

- **Safe Environment:** All messages are scanned by an ML model to filter out harmful content, ensuring a safe chatting experience for kids.

> The ML model is still in premature stage, thus some harmful msgs might still seep through. But we are actively working on fine tuning our model for a better experience

- **Room-Based Chat:** Kids can create or join chat rooms by simply entering a room name. All participants in the room can communicate with each other.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Powered by Socket.io, KinderChat provides real-time messaging, making conversations smooth and instantaneous.
- **User Authentication:** Simple and secure login and registration process with password encryption.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Messages are analysed for sentiment to detect any negative or harmful language.
